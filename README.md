# Coursera Algorithm I

Coursera Algorithm I covers elementary data structures and sorting, searching algorithms.
This repository contains:
* The unit tests I used to validate if my solution to the course assignments are correct or not. Be mindful it does not cover time and space complexity assessment but only correctness.
* My solution to the course assignment.

# Assignments
* [Week 1 - Percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)
* [Week 2 - Deque / Random Queues](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html)
* [Week 3 - Collinear Points](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html)
* [Week 4 - 8 Puzzle](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html)

# How to build
`mvn clean test` compile project, run checkstyle, findbugs, PMD, jacoco and execute unit tests.

# Warning
I encourage you to use the unit test defined within this project to test if your solutions is correct or not.
Only look at my solution after trying to solve the assignments by yourselves.
